# weather-report
Over view:
To run this application, we can directly open the index.html file in browser (I will suggest chrome browser for better UI).
As per requirement we are displaying 5 days weather report by using Location/City name.
Here we are using default location as Pune while loading application first time.

If we get more time to implement it then we can add few more functionality here like,
1. We can change default location/city name based on current geo location.
2. We can change "Search for:" text. Currently we are displaying country code instead of country name. This functionality we can implement here.
3. We are using bootstrap framework here to make this application responsive but we can make it more responsive for user experience by hiding/showing search result based on browser size.
4. We can also display images based on weather conditions (like Rain, shower, clear sky, etc.).
